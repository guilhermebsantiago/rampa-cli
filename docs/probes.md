# Probes

A probe drives a web page after Rampa has collected it, read-only, and records what it saw. Rules then turn those facts into findings. This is how Rampa checks criteria that no static scan can: what happens when the page is narrowed to 320 CSS px, when text spacing is raised, when someone moves through it with the keyboard.

```
target ─► collect (snapshot + axe) ─► probes (--probe) ─► rules and criteria ─► report
                                         │                      ▲
                                         └─ snapshot.observations ─┘   (rules read only the snapshot)
```

Probes are **off by default**. Turn them on per run:

```sh
rampa check https://example.com --probe all          # layout and keyboard
rampa check page.html --probe layout                 # reflow (1.4.10) and text spacing (1.4.12)
rampa check page.html --probe keyboard               # 2.1.1, 2.1.2, 3.2.1, 2.4.7, 2.4.11
rampa check page.html --probe all --save .rampa/rec  # keep the observations to replay offline
```

Why off: each probe loads the page again, and the keyboard walk takes screenshots at every Tab stop, so a probed page costs seconds to tens of seconds more than an unprobed one. The plan ([wcag-coverage.md](plans/wcag-coverage.md), 4.6) makes each kind a default only after it passes the evaluation gate and its cost is measured on real pages. `--probe` works with `rampa check` on URLs and HTML files; it does not run with `--crawl` yet.

## What a probe may do

Every probe in this release is in the **observe** class:

- it presses Tab, Shift+Tab and Esc, and the arrow keys only to try to leave a suspected keyboard trap;
- it resizes the viewport and injects CSS;
- it moves focus away with `blur()` to compare a focused element with its unfocused self;
- it never clicks, never presses Enter or Space on a control, never types, and never submits a form.

Each probe kind opens its own browser context with the same storage state, headers, cookies, color scheme and device settings as the collection (the layout probes force a 1280×1024 desktop window, as browser zoom would), and loads the page fresh, so one probe's state never leaks into another's.

### The network guard

The guard is on for the whole life of a probe page, including its load:

- only GET, HEAD and OPTIONS reach the network; every other request, `sendBeacon` included, is aborted and logged;
- once the page has loaded, a top-level navigation is answered locally with 204 and logged: the page stays, and the attempt is evidence (3.2.1);
- WebSockets and EventSource are blocked;
- `window.open` is hooked: it is logged and returns `null`; any popup that opens anyway is closed;
- form submission is hooked and cancelled, and logged;
- `alert`, `confirm` and `prompt` are dismissed (`confirm` answers cancel) and logged;
- downloads are refused and service workers are blocked, so nothing answers a request behind the guard's back;
- permission prompts are denied (Playwright grants none).

A GET can still have side effects on a badly built server. That cannot be ruled out, which is why probes never click. Every probe record lists what the guard blocked and which navigations it answered.

### Determinism

- When probes run, the browser starts with `--force-color-profile=srgb --disable-lcd-text --font-render-hinting=none`.
- A probe waits for the page to settle: 300 ms with no DOM mutation and no layout shift, at most 3 s, after `document.fonts.ready`.
- Screenshots are taken with animations finished and the caret hidden.
- A verdict that rests on an absence (no pixel changed on focus, focus never left a set of elements) is measured twice before it becomes a finding.
- Each record carries its conditions: viewport, device scale factor, browser and version, variant, color scheme.

## Observations in the snapshot

Probe facts go in `snapshot.observations.probes`, an optional field, so `schemaVersion` stays 1 and the published [JSON schema](../schema/snapshot.schema.json) describes it:

```ts
interface ProbeRecord {
  kind: 'layout' | 'keyboard' | …
  version: string                 // the probe's version; a rule states which versions it reads
  conditions: { viewport, deviceScaleFactor, browser, variant?, colorScheme?, reducedMotion? }
  status: 'complete' | 'partial' | 'skipped'
  reason?: string                 // 'stop budget reached (150)', 'probe failed: …'
  guard: { blocked: [{ method, url, at }], navigations: [{ url, at, cause? }], dialogs: [{ type, message, at }] }
  durationMs: number
  data: unknown                   // per kind: refs, identities, boxes and measured numbers; never verdicts
}
```

**Node identity.** Probes run on a fresh load, and pages change between loads. Every element a probe reports carries the snapshot ref (the same CSS path the collector writes) and an identity: its tag plus its `id`, `role`, `type`, `name` and `href` attributes. A rule reports an element only when the ref resolves in the snapshot and the identity matches; otherwise the fact is *unmatched*, counted in the coverage line, and never becomes a finding.

**Offline replay.** Rules are pure functions of the snapshot. `rampa check --save dir` writes the observations with the snapshot, and `rampa check dir/page.snapshot.json` judges them again with no browser, giving the same findings. A threshold can change and a saved run be judged again.

## How results are reported

- **Findings** from probe rules have `source: "probe"`, name the element, and carry the measured evidence (sizes, offsets, the key sequence) in `evidence`.
- **Experimental.** Every probe rule is experimental until it passes the evaluation gate in the plan (4.9). Its findings are reported **below the confidence threshold**: they show with `--verbose`, or as confirmed findings with `--min-confidence low`, and `--fail-on any` counts them.
- **Needs review** (`report.needsReview`): what a person must look at, such as text that overlaps after spacing is raised or a faint focus change. Never a failure, never part of the exit code.
- **Beyond the target.** Rampa's reports target WCAG 2.1. A 2.4.11 result (new in WCAG 2.2) is shown and marked "beyond the 2.1 target", and never counts toward the exit code.
- **Coverage, per criterion and method.** `report.coverage.probes` lists, for each criterion a probe rule checked, the method and probe version, the conditions, how many elements it applied to, failures, items to review and unmatched facts. A probed criterion leaves the "not checked" list. "No failure found" applies to the conditions shown; it is never a pass.

## The checks

### 1.4.10 Reflow (`--probe layout`, rule `rampa/reflow`)

**The probe.** The page loads in a 1280×1024 desktop window and settles; every element that owns text, and every control, is measured: its text box (the union of its own text fragments), the part of it that ancestors with `overflow: hidden` or `clip` leave visible, whether it sits inside content that needs two dimensions, and which pieces of text of different elements overlap. The window is then resized to 320×256 CSS px, which is 1280×1024 at 400% zoom (Understanding 1.4.10), and everything is measured again. Resizing instead of reloading is what zoom does; the window is in desktop mode, so the viewport meta is ignored as it is under browser zoom. Whether the window really scrolls sideways is tested by scrolling, not read from `scrollWidth`, because `overflow` on `html` or `body` can hide what `scrollWidth` reports.

Content that needs two dimensions is exempt by element type: `img`, `video`, `canvas`, `svg`, `math`, `pre`, `code`, `iframe`, `object`, `embed`, `role=application`, and data tables with header cells (the table as a whole). Text inside an element that scrolls sideways on its own is not "past the edge".

**The rule.**

| Observation | Result |
|---|---|
| The window scrolls sideways at 320 px and visible text or a control, outside exempt content, extends past the right edge (1 px tolerance) | failure, high |
| Text partly cut at 320 px (2 px across, or a quarter of a line down) that was whole at 1280 px | failure, high |
| The same, when a `title` or `aria-label` holds the full text, the cutting container hides other text completely (a carousel), or it shows an ellipsis | needs review |
| Text of two elements that overlaps at 320 px and did not at 1280 px | needs review |
| Text that disappears at 320 px (collapsed navigation, F102) | not reported: finding it needs the menu opened, which the observe class never does |

At most 10 findings per kind are listed; the coverage line counts the rest. Evidence gives the scroll width, the element's horizontal extent and how far it passes the edge, or how many pixels are cut and by which element.

**Limits.** One browser engine (Chromium). 320×256 is an emulation: a real 1280×1024 screen at 400% leaves about 318×236, hence the tolerances. Horizontal scrolling inside a container that is not exempt is not reported yet. Text in open shadow roots is measured, but it is unmatched in the snapshot, which does not collect shadow roots, so it is never reported.

### 1.4.12 Text Spacing (`--probe layout`, rule `rampa/text-spacing`)

**The probe.** A fresh page at 1280×1024 is measured with the same core as reflow. Then the four values the criterion names go on every element, open shadow roots included, as a user style sheet would set them: `line-height: 1.5`, `letter-spacing: 0.12em`, `word-spacing: 0.16em`, and `margin-bottom: 2em` on `p` (the W3C bookmarklet's choice). They are inline `!important` declarations, which win over the author's `!important` the way a user style sheet does. The page settles and is measured again; the comparison is the page against itself before the change.

The criterion is about the user's override, not the author's values; axe-core's `avoid-inline-spacing` keeps covering the inline `!important` case (ACT 24afc2, 78fd32, 9e45ec).

**Scripts.** Word spacing is not applied when the page's language is written without spaces between words (`ja`, `zh`, `th`, `lo`, `km`, `my`, `bo`), and the coverage line says "not applied: word-spacing (lang ja)". The other metrics are applied to every language; that is a simplification of the Understanding's note.

| Observation | Result |
|---|---|
| Text partly cut with the spacing that was whole before (F104; C35 and C36 fail) | failure, high |
| Cut to an ellipsis, and no `title` or `aria-label` holds the full text | failure, medium |
| Cut to an ellipsis, with the full text in a `title` or `aria-label` | not reported |
| Cut, when the full text is in a name or title, or the container hides other text completely (a carousel) | needs review |
| Text of two elements that overlaps with the spacing and did not before | needs review |
| Text in a container that scrolls, or text already cut before the spacing | not reported |

**Limits.** A metric a script does not use is only left out for word spacing. Text drawn in canvas or in images is not measured. Content that a page re-renders with JavaScript after a style change may settle late; the probe waits up to 3 s.
